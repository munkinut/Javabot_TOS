JavaBot Scripting

JavaBot scripting is implemented in BeanShell, which is essentially 
interpretted Java with some convenience commands, a pre-imported 
classpath and the option to code in a "looser" syntax.  Details about
BeanShell scripting can be found at http://www.beanshell.org.

Scripts

Scripts are put in the scripts directory (compiled/org/javabot/scripts) 
and are named thusly :

    <command>.bsh

    E.g.

    wibble.bsh

To invoke a script, do :

    !<bot's nick> <command>

    E.g.

    !javamunk wibble

To invoke a script with parameters, do :

    !<bot's nick> <command> <parameters>

    E.g.

    !javamunk wibble wobble wobble

Script API

JavaBot BeanShell scripts have access to a resource created for them 
by JavaBot called "scriptResource".  The essentially provides a simple 
API with the following public methods : 

    getChannel()    -   returns the bot's current channel
    getNick()       -   returns the nick who invoked the script
    getHostmask()   -   returns the hostmask who invoked the script, 
                        in the form <ident>@<host domain>
    getParams()     -   returns a Vector of parameters passed to the script

    msgNick(String message)     -   sends a message to (getNick())
    msgChannel(String message)  -   sends a message to (getChannel())

The example script wibble.bsh gives a basic example.

    // wibble.bsh
    nick = scriptResource.getNick();
    scriptResource.msgChannel("hi " + nick + ".  wibble wibble :)");
    //

This script will be invoked (assuming the bot's nick is javamunk) when 
someone types:

    !javamunk wibble

And will result in (assuming the invoking nick was munki):

    > hi munki. wibble wibble :)

Of course this is a very simple example for illustration, but BeanShell is 
powerful little beast with lots of possibilities.
