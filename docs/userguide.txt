JavaBot User Guide (c) Warren Milburn 2001

Introduction

Quick Start (assumes that you have a compiled bot and are in the compiled directory)

1) Run InitUsersXML to create a default userfile containing an entry for the bot owner.

    java org.javabot.user.InitUsersXML <username> <password>

    Eg. > java org.javabot.user.InitUsersXML wibble wobble

    Will create a userfile called newusers.xml
    with the username "wibble" and password "wobble".

    This file needs to be renamed to users.xml and placed in the config directory
    (org/javabot/config).

    This user has their bot owner flag set to true and can then add more flags for 
    themselves and create more users once the bot is running.

2) Edit the javabot.properties file (org/javabot/config/javabot.properties)

    This contains directives for the server and port, channel and the bots name.
    Please ensure you specify the channel name in lowercase.
    The file also contains switches for various options such as autovoice and flood protection.

3) Run JavaBot.

    Eg. > java org.javabot.gui.javabot

4) Start JavaBot.

    Click the "Connect" button or choose "Connect" from the "File" menu.

5) Once connected JavaBot will enter the channel on the network you specified 
   in the javabot.properties file and set some default flags.

6) You may then enter the channel on which the bot is sitting.
   It is obviously best to send the bot to a channel on which it can gain ops.

7) Authenticate yourself with the bot

    /msg <botname> auth <username> <password>

    where <botname> is the name of your JavaBot, <username> is the username 
    you set up previously, and <password> is the password you set up 
    previously.

    Eg. /msg javabot auth wibble wobble

8) You will be met with a default greet message which you can change later.

9) That's it!
