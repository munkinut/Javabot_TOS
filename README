JavaBot README (c) 2001 Warren Milburn

The install and user docs can be found in the docs directory.  You might want to 
read those as they will tell you how to establish yourself as the bot owner by 
creating a new default userfile.  Alternatively, you can edit the existing user file 
by hand - you will find that in compiled/org/javabot/config/userfile.xml.

As a quickstart guide : 

1) Ensure you have Java 1.3.x installed
2) Run the compile script

	.\compile.bat  (windows)
	./compile.sh   (unix)

3) Change to the "compiled" directory
4) Run the run script

	.\run.bat  (windows)
	./run.sh   (unix)
