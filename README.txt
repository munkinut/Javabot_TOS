JavaBot README (c) 2001 munki
Revised 2020 munki

An IRC bot written in Java, now updated to compile with Java 14 to Java 9 level. This is the predecessor of Javabot_TNG although it is better in some ways.  It has more functionality and a GUI interface.

The install and user docs can be found in the docs directory, although these are now out of date.  You might want to read those as they will tell you how to establish yourself as the bot owner by creating a new default userfile.  Alternatively, you can edit the existing user file by hand.
